This project demonstrates how a retail organization can move from reactive reporting to AI-powered predictive analytics using Power BI.
It includes forecasting models, anomaly detection, seasonality insights, and automated smart narratives to support better business decisions.

🚩 Problem Statement

The retail organization faces challenges due to increasing sales data and traditional manual reporting methods. Management wants to:

🔮 Forecast future sales

⚠️ Detect unusual sales patterns (anomalies)

📈 Identify risks and opportunities early

Manual reports are no longer sufficient.
The organization needs an AI-powered dashboard that provides clear insights, predictions, and automated interpretations.

As an Advanced BI Analyst, this project aims to:

Analyze historical sales trends

Identify seasonality patterns

Build forecast models using Power BI AI features & DAX

Implement Anomaly Detection

Auto-generate insights using Smart Narratives

Provide decision-ready insights for management
